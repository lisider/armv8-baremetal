      2    Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [running]) 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

    All other execution methods will show that
    (gdb) info threads
      Id   Target Id                    Frame
    * 1    Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [running]) _start () at el1_boot.S:8
      2    Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [halted ]) _start () at el1_boot.S:8
